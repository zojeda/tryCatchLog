\usage{

        \item{severity    - the serverity level of the log entry (ERROR, WARNING, MESSAGE) as \code{character}}
        \item{log.message - the message text of the log entry as \code{character}}
        \item{compact.stack.trace - the short stack trace containing only entries with source code
                                    references down to line of code that has thrown the condition as \code{character}}
        \item{full.stack.trace    - the full stack trace with all calls down to the line of code that
                                    has thrown the condition (including calls to R internal functions
                                    and other functions even when the source code in not available) as \code{character}}
        }
}
\description{
The last logging result after calling \code{tryCatchLog} or \code{tryLog} can be retrieved by
calling this function.
}
\details{
The typical use case is to get and store the log output not only in a log file but
also in another place that is not supported by \code{futile.logger}, e. g. in
a data base table of your application or displaying it in a GUI (user interface).

Another use case is to review the last log output on the console during debugging.
